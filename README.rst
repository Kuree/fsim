xsim: Fiber-based SystemVerilog Simulator
===================================================

``xsim`` is a lightweight SystemVerilog simulator based on userland fibers. It leverages `slang`_
as a frontend to parse any SystemVerilog files. ``xsim`` is guided by the following design goals:

1. Concurrent and event-driven. Fine-grained multi-threading using fibers.
2. Performant. Compiles SystemVerilog into C++ code.
3. Fast to compile. Supports incremental and parallel builds builds via ``ninja``.


How to install
-------------
The easiest way to install is via ``pip``. Simply do

.. code:: bash

    pip install xsim-python

Notice that for maximum compatibility, the Linux wheel is shipped with ``gcc``, which allows xsim to be installed
on any Linux system. macOS should work out of the box if the development tools are installed.


To build from source, you can use the following commands. Notice that you also need ``ninja`` installed
in your environment path.

.. code:: bash

   git submodule update --init
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   make -j

Usage
-----
Once ``xsim`` is installed, you should find ``xsim`` executable in your path. The usage is similar to other
commercial simulators and C/C++ compilers. For instance, to run a simple testbench, we can do

.. code:: bash

   xsim design.sv tb.sv

The command above will compile the SystemVerilog into an executable called ``xsim.out``. You can override it
with ``-o`` option. You can then start the simulation by running the executable. A working directory called
``xsim_dir`` is created to store compilation files.

To run the simulation automatically after the compilation, we can use ``-R`` flag, e.g.:

.. code:: bash

   xsim -R design.sv tb.sv

This feature is simular to Incisive/Xcelium. Notice that if the files are unmodified, subsequent run will not
trigger a new compilation.
